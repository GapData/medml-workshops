# Medical data processing and ML workshops

<!-- [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jakubzitny/medml-workshops) -->


Workshop for medical students interested in data processing and machine learning, for ML students interested in medical data and for anyone with programming or data analysis background interested in ML.


We'll introduce Python basics, tools for processing and visualizing data, dive into ML and DL basics, play with CNNs and GANs.
